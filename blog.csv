Whenever I think of dresses, Tory Burch pops up in my head! That might be due to the fact that I still remember how I saw the now available Tory Burch collection on the runway and I immediately fell for its beautiful prints! There was one dress especially that I loved so much that I posted a picture of the model wearing it on the runway on Instagram (which I rarely do :)). Thus, you might be able to imagine how thrilled I was when now I finally got to hold that very dress in my hands and actually got to wear it! 
I had been to Palm Springs last year for the first time but lived a bit out of the city and didn’t quite get the right feel for the place. However, this year I got to live right in the city center for Coachella and I totally fell for Palm Springs’ charm – the landscape, the mountains surrounding the city, the vegetation and the beautiful houses standing amidst nature’s beauty. Especially the more chic parts of the city, where every house was a bit like a piece of art, reminded be of the colorful prints of the recent Tory Burch collection. And therefore I jumped right into my new dress and took it for a stroll. It didn’t take long until I found a house that, I am sure, my Tory dress would have immediately signed the lease for if only it could write (and think ;)).
In today’s pictures I combined the Tory Burch dress with my beloved golden Gucci shoes, and my new Tory Burch bag. To add even more color (and summer vibes) to the outfit I wore the dress with my amazing Fendi sunnies! I hope you like the look!
Today’s pictures were taken on my way to the Max Mara Show in Milan. For a change we were not running late and I had to make the tough decision what to do with the spare time: 1. get my second soya latte of the day at my beloved Panini Durini (because the hotel coffee unfortunately did not meet the admittedly high Italian standard) or 2. stop in front of Il Duomo to take some pictures. As you can see I decided on the latter but no worries: we happened to walk past a Panini Durini afterwards and I did get my extra caffeine boost before the show after all. Since the show took place early in the morning we had the Duomo – one of my favorite Milan locations – nearly to ourselves and were able to take pictures undisturbed. I am wearing a striped pair of Max Mara pants that I borrowed for the show from the brand together with a Prada sweater from Net-a-Porter with a robot print (yes, sometimes I have to nurture my inner Sheldon Cooper) and a bomber by Topshop Unique. I spruced the black-mix up with my red Chanel bag. My biggest obsession though were the SANAYI313 booties that I got at Net-a-Porter as well and that I wore several times during fashion week. However, my favorite accessory when shooting at Il Duomo are the pigeons. While I can easily go without the usual tourist tradition of attracting them with bird food, I don’t mind one fluttering through the picture once in a while – it wouldn’t be Il Duomo without them!
When I am in Paris and I feel like I have seen enough of the Eiffel Tower (which admittedly rarely happens), I love to visit some of my favorite places. One day during Paris Fashion Week we had the most wonderful weather and you could really feel that spring was in the air. So we headed to my favorite Parisian street, where every house has a different pastel color reminding me of the colors of a spring meadow in full bloom. I am very much in love with trench coats at the moment and since the temperatures were up for the first time, I grabbed the chance to wear my new crème colored MAX&Co. trench for the first time. The trench coat has the most amazing bow details and I am crazy about bows at the moment. I combined the light coat with a wrap around blouse by Storets, a pair of MLM jeans, my beloved Chloé sunnies, a pair of Josefinas sneakers and my new Tory Burch T Satchel bag. I can’t wait for spring to come and stay so that it is trench coat weather every single day。
I think we have never had less time to shoot an outfit than this particular time. On the last day of NYFW I had to go to LA a bit early. But before the flight I attended the Michael Kors show, to which I had been looking forward especially much! For the occasion I wore a Michael Kors blue fake fur jacket from Net-a-Porter with some shades of blue: Frame jeans and a Miu Miu bag in a jeans design. I combined the outfit with my Gucci sneakers with heart and an asymmetrical blouse by Jacquemus. And my 7 � nerd glasses, which my sister officially barred me from wearing any more because she says I am otherwise wearing the look out. The Michael Kors show was simply amazing. I had goose bumps when the orchestra started playing and the first models stepped on the catwalk. It was a great collection with lots of beautiful layering pieces, shade-in-shade looks, and cool oversized pieces. You can read more about the show in my NYFW Update: here. Afterwards we were supposed to rush back to our hotel to grab our suitcases but I really wanted to shoot some pictures first. Therefore we ended up shooting in this new construction side location… but it’s very NY as well, isn’t it?!
During fashion week the calendar tends to be even more crammed than usually. But among all those busy days, Valentine’s Day was definitely a winner and therefore we rented a car that day to get from show to show more quickly. Despite the rush there must have been some love in the air because on our way to a nice spot where we had wanted to shoot my outfit for the Zimmermann show, we passed a beautiful new love wall by chance. <3 Who am I to ignore Cupid’s signs? We simply had to get out of the car and ended up shooting the look right on the spot. All my Zimmermann clothes are rather airy and light because I love their flowery dresses the most. Thus New York’s temperatures forced me to pick some of my other clothes for the look. In the pictures I am wearing a Tory Burch coat, with which I fell in love during the fitting, over a cozy black sweater. I combined it with my Chloé Faye bag that makes me long for summer, Gucci sunglasses and some of my beloved oldies. When packing for fashion week you never quite know yet what you will end up wearing to the shows because most of the fittings take place once you are there. Therefore I always pack some of my favorite basics such as overknee boots, leather shorts and my favorite blouse. You can combine them with almost everything and having them with you all the time gives you more possibilities to combine your new statement pieces. We ended up taking pictures for so long that I didn’t have time to change for the next show and I ended up giving the Tory coat another outing. I didn’t mind since I simply looooove the coat! Isn’t Tori Burch the champion of coats?! 
After our long flight from Panama to Paris over Frankfurt, the super exciting Victoria’s Secret Show, and the aftershow party, I was so tired that I could have stayed in bed all day the next day. But when the Eiffel Tower is only 1 km from your hotel, you can almost hear it calling for you! Although I’ve been to Paris so many times already, I still have to visit the Eiffel Tower every time I am there – and thus I did make it out of bed this time as well. After Panama I’ve been a bit overwhelmed by the European winter weather. But in Paris the sun came out and I had my new cozy Drykorn jacket to keep me warm!:) In Today’s pictures I am wearing MR by Man Repeller Flats, which I fell in love with on first sight: suede and lace-up details – who can say no to that? I know I can’t… I combined them with my new Valentino Rockstud Spike bag. I am so happy with my new back, partly because it fits my Givenchy boots so perfectly. And I am wearing a new pair of Mavi jeans. I already have a pair of grey skinny jeans and a pair of Mom jeans from Mavi and recently I added this black pair to the collection. I like wearing jeans in dark shades, and black and anthracite are my absolute favorites. Today I rolled up the jeans’ legs so that one could see the lace-up details of the shoes. What is it about the Eiffel Tower that leaves you enchanted every time?
As soon as we came back from Marrakech, we had a few open meetings in London and spontaneously organized a quick trip. When only having limited time to repack my luggage, I love to take some favorite basics with me. There are a some pieces, which can be styled casual as well as chic. My personal favorites for such an occasion are flat shoes (boots or sneakers), a cool pair of denim jeans, a special blouse and a statement bag. I also recently bought a Gucci belt which easily makes an outfit a little more special. I’ve always been into denim and there are quite some models I really love. I do always take a pair of used jeans and skinny jeans with me and to give a little contrast to a chic blouse, I love to pair Mom jeans. The ones I’m wearing today are from Mavi and they have a cool, loose fit and the perfect neutral blue color which works with so many looks. It’s my second pair of Mavi jeans and I’m obsessed – Do you also remember the skinny Mavi jeans I styled in Paris (here)? And even though it was still sunny and nice in London, it was time to say goodbye to off-shoulder blouses and I switched to a ruffle blouse which also is a little playful.We were staying at the Mondrian London and only had a short walk to London Eye and all the pretty London views. Isn’t today’s scenery such a typical London one!? Even though there isn’t a city I’ve visited more often than London, I still feel like I discover so many new places every time I come back. Such an amazing, vibrant, diverse place. See you soon, London!
Pink seems a returning thing on THEFASHIONGUITAR.com lately, which is funny, because not long ago, I didn’t really see myself as the girl who would wear pink, at all. I guess it all comes down – as usual – to the perfect tone, the right piece, and other factors that make a look feel good. In this case, though, it was the skirt that pulled me in, and I just needed something long, preferably a knit, to wear on top of it. My favorite casual attire, as we all know by now.
And there it was, this crazy bright pink knit. Almost too pink for anyone’s good… if that’s even a thing to say. Anyway, I just felt it, it was the perfect combination together with the velvet bag and buckled shoes. A cold spring day doesn’t ask for much more than this…
Back from Costa Rica and holding on to those holiday vibes so badly! Although more in Positano-ways than the Costa Rican… Or in fact, maybe that headband does add a little of that Central American beauty. Because oh boy, did I fall in love with that country. Even though we were there only for a couple of days, it was enough to completely go mad for it! But… we are back, and that means back to work. Nothing bad about that, I luckily still LOVE – almost – every single bit of it, but as always after a vacation, there SO MUCH work to do!! The best part about that is shooting new looks, Spring looks to be precise. And kicking of with a perfect sunny spring office look!
Brands that are all – as you know – on my list of favorites, and colors that I feel work perfect with my hair color and my light tan. Thank you NET-A-PORTER for setting me up with the perfect “back to work” look. It’s hard to beat a Monday morning on a beach – see my Instagram to know what I’m talking about – but a headpiece makes definitely a good second. Life’s just better with a little polka dots on the side…
I love this look for so many reasons. I did back then – in January when I attended the Valentino Pre-Fall 2017 show in New York – and I still do today. But the funny thing was that that particular morning before the show, a thought crossed my mind – only for a few seconds – something along the line of “is this too much?” I almost never doubt any of my looks, especially not when a look feels so “me”, but the bright pink hair made me wonder… To much pink? To many prints clashing? Is my free interpretation of the Valentino Resort collection was a bit “too free”?
Luckily this feeling left my brain as fast as it entered it, and I closed my hotel room door behind me, heading all the way downtown to see the beautiful Valentino Pre-Fall 2017 show in the Beekman Hotel. On the two top floors of this grand hotel, with bright beautiful natural light coming in from the roof, formed the runway for punk elegance by PierPaolo Piccioli’s Pre-Fall 2017 solo collection. Remember that red sequin dress… and those sneakers under some of his dresses? You know me quite well by now, so I’m sure you agree that this collection was 100% blowing my mind – and still does…
And then of course, the Pre-Fall show was quickly followed by his Couture and Ready-to-Wear shows in Paris. Where did the time go?
Only a few weeks ago I was completely surprised – I literally didn’t believe the weather forecast when arriving with spring weather – by the blizzard that hit New York on the first day of New York Fashion Week. Yet again, yesterday, I saw people being in complete disbelieve on their Instagram that tomorrow – today as we speak – a snow storm called Stella would hit the city again… But it did. And so did “regular winter weather” hit Toronto too. Somehow, whenever we move houses or cities in North America we have to deal with a snow storm. Which makes me wonder, is this a sign from the weather gods we shouldn’t? Well, no matter what, as changeable as the weather is, so is the place we call “home”. While New York is getting ready for the aftermath of Stella, we are preparing for yet another move… Getting better at it every time!
Looking at these photos I can only think “I miss my pink hair” and that I have to color it again for New York Fashion Week. Which is, by the way, starting TOMORROW. But not to worry this season… Because with a full but organized agenda, a rack full of amazing looks to wear, I feel quite relax about it all. Honestly, for the first time in 5 years of fashion weeks, I’m not completely freaking out about everything I still need to do/plan/pack/request/sort. I guess it’s a simple “I’ve learned from my mistakes” situation, and practice does really make perfect – as much as possible in this case. And I’m proud of myself for managing it all so much better than previous seasons. Not that anything would change for you really, because if I would not have told you about it, you would probably never know…
And that’s the beauty and the beast of my job. I go to the most amazing shows, I wear the most beautiful looks, and sleep in fancy hotels. It all looks pretty fly, because it is, and because I mastered the art of curating my life for the sake of my job. No signs of heat flashes that result in wet armpits, no pale-faced photos because of a cold I’m fighting, it’s all taken care off. Needless to say, it’s been taken care of with great thought behind it, because the last thing I want is living a “double life”. What you see on my blog and on my social media is real. A 100%. Because I know that whenever I step away from that “realness”, you guys catch me doing it instantly, and that’s reflected in the engagement. I know that, but I still learn from all of this every day. Like I said yesterday; the only thing that matters, is that I do what is “me”. That way I can engage in any collaboration my guts tell me to do…
Gosh… So many “deep thoughts” lately, I really hope you don’t mind… It’s just good for me sometimes to write about those things that are on my mind. It helps me organize my thoughts and structure them in a way I see the future more clear. There is so much I want for thefashionguitar.com, and I feel I’m on the edge of big changes. Even though there is no timeframe to provide you with, I promise that if you stick around, you will be part of it. Until then: Fashion Month baby!! Can’t wait for you to start…
Navy is for restless energy and understated elegance. It shines boldness, optimism and serenity. Spring will not pull me away from this color, nor this fuzzy texture.
The lasting impact of victorian-inspired trend will forever embrace romance. The gentle statement of voluminous sleeves and high collar ruffle necklines are my absolute favorites. It has such a beautiful feminine silhouette and can be dressed up or down for various occasions. I’ve chosen a more casual way this time, paired with cuff boyfriend jeans, finished with extraordinary details of pointed piercing shoes with pearls and sparkles. And thank you so much for those of you who helped pick out this Louis Vuitton bag via my Instagram stories over the weekend!
Out of many pairs of gorgeous shoes I’ve brought to NYFW, I have specifically chosen a pair of my favorites to style it in three different ways, in partnership with Sam Edelman. One of their most popular styles, the Cambell Bootie, came in this blooming multi floral print which enhanced many of my fashion week outfits, as well as a perfect pair of subtle statement boots for daily meetings back in LA. It gives any outfit a lively movement, and a gorgeous pair merging into Spring. Aside from these bootie, their newest Brandie (sleek satin pointed toe flats with winding ankle ties) and Leya (fur pom pom sneaker) is also on the top of my list. As always, life is too short to wear boring shoes right? 
Mondays got me flashing back to a week ago in New York for Fashion Week. And this season, we focused on styling with denim during most events there, especially with a brand I’ve loved for the longest time, Paige. With the continued hot denim trend with various designs and washes – the raw hem, hi-lo, vintage-like ones especially, really has a special place in my wardrobe. Paige’s Vintage Collection, with all vintage styles that I’ll live in, with favorite silhouettes and detailing so versatile and effortless chic. I wore these Vintage ‘Julia’ multiple times throughout NYFW, and they’re my absolutely favorite. Aside from this collection, Paige also dressed me in some of their cutest styles from their new arrivals including the Colette Crop Flare featuring frayed lace-up closure, as well as pieces from their collaboration with Rosie HW.
As much as we need to catch up on what’s trendy, it’s more important to gear up our closets with staples that we can wear almost any season, with pieces that we will continue to love in a year, two, or even longer. No matter if it’s that effortless voluminous cardigan, the perfect pair of loose trousers, or versatile statement boots.
It’s so good, so, so good. Classically luxe as ever. Stepping up the game this season with a pair of sneakers that will elevate any casual looks. Wanted to quickly share New Balance’s premium style ‘247 Luxe’ kicks that I’m absolutely in aww for. I was never really a huge fan of sporty sneakers, but these changed the game. What I love about these is the camel/tan unique color enhancements with the buttery leather design, it just feels and looks so different from any other semi athletic designs. Wore these for the first time just yesterday as we headed to a few client meetings in downtown and trying to stay comfy all at once, so instead of my regular go-to ankle boots or heels, gave these a try and never want to take them off again. Maybe I’m also having a new thing for tan, obvious no? 
The perfect balance between extremes, grey represents wisdom and stability. The color for getting things done.
Been living in big coats, and of course this fuzzy cardigan coat of mine. Starting off the week in downtown comfortably in layers of grey and a little glam thanks to Luisaviaroma for these awesome pearl piercing shoes by Coliac. Since the splurge of the Gucci pearl boots and eyeing their various pearl detailed handbags, anything pearl-related, I’m all in. The pointed-toe classic silhouette is edgy, yet the crystals and pearls gives it a sophisticated feminine touch, what more can I ask for?
Look, we know – seeing as we live in Singapore, it technically is swimsuit season all year round. (Technically, because we still have the monsoons.) It may even come off as pretentious for us to declare its arrival. But you know what, just leave us be. There’s always room for one more one-piece or bikini when spring’s new arrivals hit the stores. Plus, all the bikini season coverage we’re seeing on social media from all of you across the Pacific is getting us super stoked about living the island life. Plus-plus, we’re headed to a certain somewhere where a swimsuit or two may come in handy. But that’s news for a later date. *wink wink*
Whether you’re headed to an island resort or just chilling at a local beach, we’ve got the only swimsuits you need to stay ahead of the pack. There’s not a triangle bikini in sight, we promise. Just extremely on-trend ruffles, off-the-shoulders and one-shoulders, lace-ups, logomania and convertibles.
Quite often when you have a leather jacket in your hand, your mind automatically imagines it with a t-shirt, seasoned jeans and boots that say “don’t you dare mess with me”. A motorcycle in the background and some wind in your hair if you really want to get into that The Wild One theme. Rarely do you imagine it with a pair of lazy mules or exaggerated ruffles, for instance.
But we’re switching things up, partner. Spring has sprung at last, so we’re giving in to looser and floatier silhouettes that embrace the breeze. Plus, the leather jacket in question is insanely embellished on its own already, so we’re letting it be the main star of the show. It’s got feathers, bottle caps, leather flowers, ball chains – and that’s just what we can see without scrutinising every detail. It’s saying, “Yo, I know I look pretty rad, but like, you know, whatevs.”
We paired it with a simple white shirt, a silky skirt that’s almost cocktail and those same old loafers that you’ve seen here for the umpteenth time (shop it here and here). Extremely simple, totally unfussy.
You know what they say about how when you’re at the bottom, the only way to go is up? Well, your mom told you wrong, kids. It is possible to get even worse at a thing that you already suck at and I’m living proof. Last season, I took it upon myself to see what it is like to be a street style photographer at fashion week. We know it’s a tough job, but nothing quite like experiencing it all firsthand. Considering that I had zero expectations, I think I did okay. No one told me otherwise. Photoshop saved my hind, that’s for sure.
Thinking that I probably would kill it again, I decided to give it a go once more this season in Milan and Paris. My, oh, my, me and my big head.
Once again, Yoyo was my subject. I was frankly a little too lazy to shoot anyone else, so that’s strike one for me. We had really busy days, okay? I also forgot to shoot for more than half the shows, so that’s another strike. Finally, I was too frazzled to adjust the lighting for almost all of the shots above (what you see is after some heavy editing) so they were horrendously lit. Strike three. I could go on, but no one really goes on to strike four. Do they?
Perhaps I’m being a little too severe on myself. At least I didn’t get that many photo bombers this season. Plus, I didn’t use my regular camera for these, so I could have been better. Excuses, excuses.
Tell me what you think in the comments below – and be honest! To see all of Yoyo’s street style looks from Milan and Paris taken by real photographers and not phonies like me, click here and here.
If there’s one thing you can takeaway from the latest batch of street style photos, whether in Milan or Paris, it is that anything and everything can be turned into an off-the-shoulder piece. A tailored menswear shirt, a granny cardigan, a quilted bomber jacket, so on and so forth. It is the easiest street style-approved styling trick to master. But the thing is, there’s no guarantee of 100 percent comfort with these. Just take your nearest bomber jacket, zip it up and pull one side down your shoulder. Feeling just a little suffocated at the collar? Jacket popping right back into the non-cool position with the slightest movement of your arm? We thought so.
Enter the solution: pieces that come with their own shoulder-baring features. They’re born that way! No need to keep pulling one side down just to make sure the world – and its street photographers – sees your décolletage or that shoulder curve! If the dress or shirt is asymmetrical, you get extra brownie points for keeping things interesting.
With the weather slowly turning into spring, we can’t thing of a better way to start baring some skin. One shoulder, two shoulders, cut-outs, preppy, sexy, date-ready – take your pick from our favourites below. If you’re feeling particularly spring-y, don’t forget to check out our edit of the season’s best florals that you can shop right now.
Spring has sprung at last! Well, sort of. At least that’s what the calendars are telling our minds. If our mind says it’s spring, it’s spring. Doesn’t matter if you’re in a part of the world where it is sweltering outside or whether you’re knee-deep in slushy snow. Plus, with all the new florals that labels from Attico to Self-Portrait are pushing out for spring, you can’t blame anybody for wishing for the season to just friggin’ come already. We aren’t talking about your basic Manic Pixie Dream Girl-esque florals, by the way. Think structured mini dresses that look a little like strait jackets, jacquard slippers, cut-out blouses and a half-and-half dress that Margaery Tyrell would have worn if she were a millennial. And alive. Too soon?
Ask anyone in fashion about the ultimate wardrobe staple and we guarantee that there’s an eighty percent chance they’ll mention the classic white shirt. It goes with everything, you can dress it up and down, it is as timeless and universal as a red lip. But lately, we’re seeing the rise of the reconstructed shirt – a sleeve missing, collars widened to expose the shoulders, straps added at the waist, one shirt fused with two others. The street style pack can’t seem to wear a shirt that doesn’t reveal at least a good amount of décolletage these days, whether it’s from Jacquemus or up-and-coming Monse, or just a regular shirt that they’ve manhandled into a new one. (That’s what Yoyo did to the shirt she wore to Dolce & Gabbana in Milan last month.) Below, the new statement shirts to get behind in order to stay ahead.
