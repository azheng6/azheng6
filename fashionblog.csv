First of all let me say that there are several pieces of clothes that I take with me wherever I go. You might understandably guess now that I am talking about my off-shoulder blouses and dresses but today I＊m talking about the perfect pair of jeans. Since the capacity of my suitcase is limited I love clothes that go with every occasion and every outfit. I am always looking for a pair of jeans that is both comfortable so that I can wear it on long journeys but also stylish and chic so that I can also take it with me to fashion week. One of my favorite jeans labels is the Turkish label Mavi. Some of you might have noticed my favorite pairs of Mavi jeans in past outfit posts (e.g. here and here). Therefore, when Mavi asked me last year whether I would be interested in designing my own pair of jeans by the name of ※Leonie§ with them, I immediately fell for the idea! My mind kept going over different ideas and I even spend a whole day in Frankfurt with the incredibly nice Mavi team in December. Over cake and coffee we talked about different fabrics, cuts, and whatever else came into our minds. We looked at older jeans models, felt different jeans fabrics and even heatedly discussed the perfect tear in a pair of used-look jeans (no kidding ;)). It was so interesting to be a part of the work that goes into designing a pair of jeans, and it was an amazing feelings when my thoughts and wishes were finally delivered to my doorstep in a delivery box! I had been thinking back and forth about what the ※Leonie§ should be: a pair of simple but elegant black skinny jeans or rather a casual but chic used-look model? The design procedure felt a bit like a self-discovery trip. ?? Below you can see what I finally decided on (and what you will be able to purchase soon in the Mavi stores and online) in today＊s pictures that we shot on Tenerife. I really hope you like my jeans alter ego!"
thefashionguitar,ad,"There is sort of one way to wear a cross-body bag, but there＊s actually two ways of wearing the Chanel Gabrielle cross body bag. And being one of the luckiest girls in the world to own one of the new Chanel bags, I wanted to show you how that ※other way§ works. Needless to say, a Chanel bag goes with everything, but the more casual the outfit, the better. Or at least, in my opinion. So technically the bag has one long chain to wear it as a cross-body, but you will see when you wear it long like that, it＊s a bit of an odd length. For a good reason, though, because there needed to be a tiny bit extra to make it work as it was intended＃"
tsangtastic,ad,"No two styles are the same. Honestly, there aren＊t any characteristics that can be as appealing as that. As unique as each of us are, it＊s the same with one of Fall＊s best, introducing Burberry＊s Patchwork bag. My perception of Burberry has always just been the trench coat and their signature check pattern. Now, gathering the two details finished with variations of leather, snakeskin, suede and leopard-print calfskin, this petite shoulder bag with an oversized buckle inspired by their iconic trench is introduced. From the runway of London Fashion Week and now available at Burberry, it＊s the design that amplifies outfits from days to evenings."
yoyokulala,ad,"How did a checked anything become such a street style must-have? Is it the combined work of Gucci, Balenciaga, Prada and the unfading presence of Cher Horowitz and her legendary yellow checked skirt suit? We could write an essay on the steadfast appeal of checks 每 but we＊re not going to. Instead, we＊re going to show you how to style this little orange number from Prada. (Well, we＊re mainly seeing orange, everything else is just noise.)"
ohhcouture,blog ,"Whenever I think of dresses, Tory Burch pops up in my head! That might be due to the fact that I still remember how I saw the now available Tory Burch collection on the runway and I immediately fell for its beautiful prints! There was one dress especially that I loved so much that I posted a picture of the model wearing it on the runway on Instagram (which I rarely do :)). Thus, you might be able to imagine how thrilled I was when now I finally got to hold that very dress in my hands and actually got to wear it! "
thefashionguitar,blog ,"Pink seems a returning thing on THEFASHIONGUITAR.com lately, which is funny, because not long ago, I didn＊t really see myself as the girl who would wear pink, at all. I guess it all comes down 每 as usual 每 to the perfect tone, the right piece, and other factors that make a look feel good. In this case, though, it was the skirt that pulled me in, and I just needed something long, preferably a knit, to wear on top of it. My favorite casual attire, as we all know by now."
tsangtastic,blog ,"Navy is for restless energy and understated elegance. It shines boldness, optimism and serenity. Spring will not pull me away from this color, nor this fuzzy texture."
yoyokulala,blog ,"Look, we know 每 seeing as we live in Singapore, it technically is swimsuit season all year round. (Technically, because we still have the monsoons.) It may even come off as pretentious for us to declare its arrival. But you know what, just leave us be. There＊s always room for one more one-piece or bikini when spring＊s new arrivals hit the stores. Plus, all the bikini season coverage we＊re seeing on social media from all of you across the Pacific is getting us super stoked about living the island life. Plus-plus, we＊re headed to a certain somewhere where a swimsuit or two may come in handy. But that＊s news for a later date. *wink wink*"
,,"Whether you＊re headed to an island resort or just chilling at a local beach, we＊ve got the only swimsuits you need to stay ahead of the pack. There＊s not a triangle bikini in sight, we promise. Just extremely on-trend ruffles, off-the-shoulders and one-shoulders, lace-ups, logomania and convertibles."
,,"Quite often when you have a leather jacket in your hand, your mind automatically imagines it with a t-shirt, seasoned jeans and boots that say ※don＊t you dare mess with me§. A motorcycle in the background and some wind in your hair if you really want to get into that The Wild One theme. Rarely do you imagine it with a pair of lazy mules or exaggerated ruffles, for instance."
,,"But we＊re switching things up, partner. Spring has sprung at last, so we＊re giving in to looser and floatier silhouettes that embrace the breeze. Plus, the leather jacket in question is insanely embellished on its own already, so we＊re letting it be the main star of the show. It＊s got feathers, bottle caps, leather flowers, ball chains 每 and that＊s just what we can see without scrutinising every detail. It＊s saying, ※Yo, I know I look pretty rad, but like, you know, whatevs.§"
,,"We paired it with a simple white shirt, a silky skirt that＊s almost cocktail and those same old loafers that you＊ve seen here for the umpteenth time (shop it here and here). Extremely simple, totally unfussy."
,,"You know what they say about how when you＊re at the bottom, the only way to go is up? Well, your mom told you wrong, kids. It is possible to get even worse at a thing that you already suck at and I＊m living proof. Last season, I took it upon myself to see what it is like to be a street style photographer at fashion week. We know it＊s a tough job, but nothing quite like experiencing it all firsthand. Considering that I had zero expectations, I think I did okay. No one told me otherwise. Photoshop saved my hind, that＊s for sure."
,,"Thinking that I probably would kill it again, I decided to give it a go once more this season in Milan and Paris. My, oh, my, me and my big head."
,,"Once again, Yoyo was my subject. I was frankly a little too lazy to shoot anyone else, so that＊s strike one for me. We had really busy days, okay? I also forgot to shoot for more than half the shows, so that＊s another strike. Finally, I was too frazzled to adjust the lighting for almost all of the shots above (what you see is after some heavy editing) so they were horrendously lit. Strike three. I could go on, but no one really goes on to strike four. Do they?"
,,"Perhaps I＊m being a little too severe on myself. At least I didn＊t get that many photo bombers this season. Plus, I didn＊t use my regular camera for these, so I could have been better. Excuses, excuses."
,,"Tell me what you think in the comments below 每 and be honest! To see all of Yoyo＊s street style looks from Milan and Paris taken by real photographers and not phonies like me, click here and here."
,,"If there＊s one thing you can takeaway from the latest batch of street style photos, whether in Milan or Paris, it is that anything and everything can be turned into an off-the-shoulder piece. A tailored menswear shirt, a granny cardigan, a quilted bomber jacket, so on and so forth. It is the easiest street style-approved styling trick to master. But the thing is, there＊s no guarantee of 100 percent comfort with these. Just take your nearest bomber jacket, zip it up and pull one side down your shoulder. Feeling just a little suffocated at the collar? Jacket popping right back into the non-cool position with the slightest movement of your arm? We thought so."
,,"Enter the solution: pieces that come with their own shoulder-baring features. They＊re born that way! No need to keep pulling one side down just to make sure the world 每 and its street photographers 每 sees your d谷colletage or that shoulder curve! If the dress or shirt is asymmetrical, you get extra brownie points for keeping things interesting."
,,"With the weather slowly turning into spring, we can＊t thing of a better way to start baring some skin. One shoulder, two shoulders, cut-outs, preppy, sexy, date-ready 每 take your pick from our favourites below. If you＊re feeling particularly spring-y, don＊t forget to check out our edit of the season＊s best florals that you can shop right now."
,,"Spring has sprung at last! Well, sort of. At least that＊s what the calendars are telling our minds. If our mind says it＊s spring, it＊s spring. Doesn＊t matter if you＊re in a part of the world where it is sweltering outside or whether you＊re knee-deep in slushy snow. Plus, with all the new florals that labels from Attico to Self-Portrait are pushing out for spring, you can＊t blame anybody for wishing for the season to just friggin＊ come already. We aren＊t talking about your basic Manic Pixie Dream Girl-esque florals, by the way. Think structured mini dresses that look a little like strait jackets, jacquard slippers, cut-out blouses and a half-and-half dress that Margaery Tyrell would have worn if she were a millennial. And alive. Too soon?"
,,"Ask anyone in fashion about the ultimate wardrobe staple and we guarantee that there＊s an eighty percent chance they＊ll mention the classic white shirt. It goes with everything, you can dress it up and down, it is as timeless and universal as a red lip. But lately, we＊re seeing the rise of the reconstructed shirt 每 a sleeve missing, collars widened to expose the shoulders, straps added at the waist, one shirt fused with two others. The street style pack can＊t seem to wear a shirt that doesn＊t reveal at least a good amount of d谷colletage these days, whether it＊s from Jacquemus or up-and-coming Monse, or just a regular shirt that they＊ve manhandled into a new one. (That＊s what Yoyo did to the shirt she wore to Dolce & Gabbana in Milan last month.) Below, the new statement shirts to get behind in order to stay ahead."
